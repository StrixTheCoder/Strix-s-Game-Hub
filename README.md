## ðŸ“œ Disclaimer
I **do not claim ownership** of any of the games, their original code, or any remakes/ports featured on this site.  
Most, if not all, of these games were **created by other developers** â€” including HTML/JavaScript recodes, browser ports, and fan-made versions.  

I have simply built a **hub** to make it easier to access and enjoy them in one place.  

If **you are the original creator** of a game or the code for a remake/port that is included here and you would like it removed, please contact me and I will do so promptly.

For example:  
If there is a *Flappy Bird* remake featured here, the credit goes entirely to the developer(s) who created that game â€” not me.
